## Bitcoin Mirror tracks Bitcoin on Ethereum

Bitcoin Mirror is a smart contract that tracks the longest Bitcoin chain it's seen.

It doesn't rely on oracles. Instead, anyone can submit block headers, and the contract verifies proof-of-work.

This lets you prove a Bitcoin transaction on Ethereum. This requires just a merkle proof, and should be gas-efficient.
